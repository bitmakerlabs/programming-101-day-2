# Programming 101 - Day 1 - Client Side

Day one of a weekend workshop at Bitmaker that introduces all of the concepts required to build a simple web application from start to finish. We will explore all the aspects involved in front-end web development, namely HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and an introduction to some basic JavaScript.

## Getting setup

We'll do our best to keep the tools to a minimum so you can focus on the concepts and learning how to code. A great tool that enables us to focus on the tasks at hand is Cloud9. Cloud9 is a free, cloud-based editor that is available as a service. If you haven't already, head over to http://c9.io and set up your free account.

## Cloud9 Editor

Once you have an account at Cloud9, set up a new workspace:

* Name your workspace "programming-101-day-1"
* Within the section labeled "Clone from Git or Mercurial URL (optional)" paste the following url: https://github.com/bitmakerlabs/programming-101-day-1
* Select "custom" as the workspace type

## Today's Goals

* Understand basic HTML
* Create an HTML skeleton for a page
* Understand basic CSS selectors and properties
* Add various styles to our page
* Understand basic purpose of JavaScript
* Why jQuery is useful
* Add ability to handle browser events and manipulate elements on our page
