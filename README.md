# Programming 101 - Day 2 - More Javascript

Day two of a weekend workshop at Bitmaker that introduces all of the concepts required to build a simple web application. We will explore all the aspects involved in basic web development, namely HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and an introduction to some basic JavaScript.

## Getting setup

We'll do our best to keep the tools to a minimum so you can focus on the concepts and learning how to code. A great tool that enables us to focus on the tasks at hand is Cloud9. Cloud9 is a free, cloud-based editor that is available as a service. If you haven't already, head over to http://c9.io and set up your free account.

## Cloud9 Editor

Once you have an account at Cloud9, set up a new workspace:

* Name your workspace "programming-101-day-2"
* Within the section labeled "Clone from Git or Mercurial URL (optional)" paste the following url: https://github.com/bitmakerlabs/programming-101-day-2
* Select "custom" as the workspace type

## Today's Goals

* Review basic programming principles
* Review Javascript basics
* Understand basic Javascript events
* Explore problem solving techniques
* Use Javascript to add some functionality to our existing base
* Understand what our application lacks and what technologies we would need to use to take it further
